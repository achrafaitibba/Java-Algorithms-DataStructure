# Setting `newArray` to `null` to Help Garbage Collection

Yes, you can set `newArray` to `null` to help the garbage collector reclaim memory. However, in your case, doing so has little impact because the variable `newArray` is a local reference, and once the method `reSize` finishes executing, the local variables (including `newArray`) will automatically be eligible for garbage collection.

## Code Example

```java
@SuppressWarnings("unchecked")
@Override
public void reSize(int newArraySize) {
    Type[] newArray = (Type[]) new Object[newArraySize]; // Create new array
    for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
        newArray[i] = array[i]; // Copy elements to new array
    }
    array = newArray; // Point original array to the new array
    newArray = null;  // Set newArray to null
}
```

# Explanation

- **`newArray = null`**: After copying the elements and reassigning the array reference, setting `newArray` to `null` explicitly helps indicate that the reference is no longer needed. However, since `newArray` is a local variable, it's going to go out of scope when the method ends, making it eligible for garbage collection either way.

## Garbage Collection

Java's garbage collector will automatically clean up any unused objects when they are no longer referenced. In this case, the old array (the original one before resizing) will be eligible for garbage collection once no references are pointing to it anymore.

## Do You Need `newArray = null`?

Setting `newArray = null` is not strictly necessary in this case, as it's a local variable, and once the method exits, all local variables will naturally be out of scope and eligible for garbage collection. The garbage collector will detect that `newArray` is no longer being referenced and will clean it up.

However, if you prefer to be explicit about making objects eligible for garbage collection, assigning `newArray = null` will do that, even though it's unnecessary for local variables that will go out of scope. In other contexts where the variable's lifetime extends beyond the method (such as class-level fields), this pattern might be more useful.

## When Setting Variables to `null` Is Useful

1. **Class-level fields**: If `newArray` were a class-level field (a member of the class), setting it to `null` would explicitly make the old array eligible for garbage collection. In that case, it's good practice to release unused resources by nullifying references.

2. **Large data structures**: If you're working with large objects or arrays that take up significant memory, explicitly setting references to `null` can help the garbage collector clean them up sooner, rather than waiting for natural scoping.
