### Java Compiled and Interpreted
- Thanks to JVM, java is hybrid:
  - Compiles the code to 'bytecode' with the javaCompiler
  - Then code is interpreted by JVM of each OS (Linux/mac/windows...) and giving us machine code
  - --> once compiled + interpreted for each OS platform = Portability

### Other
-Classes cannot be protected/private, but without a modifier (default) = (package private) -> only accessible within same package <br>
-Static members (methods, variables, and nested classes) in Java are memory-efficient because they are associated with the class itself rather than with individual instances of the class. This means they are stored in a single memory location and shared across all instances of the class. <br>
