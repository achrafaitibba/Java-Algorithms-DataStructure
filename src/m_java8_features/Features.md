# Java 8 New Features Summary

Java 8 introduced several significant features that enhanced the language's capabilities and improved developer productivity. Below is a concise list of the main new features:

## 1. Lambda Expressions
- Allow functional programming by passing behavior as method arguments.
- Make code cleaner and more readable.

## 2. Streams API
- Provide high-level abstraction for processing sequences of elements.
- Support functional operations like map, filter, and reduce.

## 3. Default and Static Methods in Interfaces
- Enable interfaces to have default method implementations.
- Facilitate evolving APIs without breaking existing implementations.

## 4. Method References
- Allow referring to a method without invoking it.
- Provide a shortcut for lambda expressions when the function is an existing method.

## 5. Functional Interfaces
- Interfaces with a single abstract method, annotated with `@FunctionalInterface`.
- Used with lambda expressions for functional programming.

## 6. Optional Class
- A container object that may or may not contain a non-null value.
- Helps avoid `NullPointerException`.
