## Summary of Using Final Fields with Constructors

### Introduction

In Java, using a constructor to initialize final fields is a recommended practice for creating immutable objects. This pattern ensures that the object's state remains constant throughout its lifecycle, offering numerous benefits.

### Benefits of Using Final Fields with Constructors

- **Immutability**: Ensures that once an object is created, its state cannot be altered, maintaining consistency.

- **Thread Safety**: Immutable objects are inherently thread-safe as their state cannot be modified by multiple threads.

- **Predictable Behavior**: With unchanging state, the behavior of objects is easier to predict and reason about.

- **Safety in Concurrent Environments**: Reduces the risk of bugs related to shared mutable state.

- **Cacheability and Hashing**: Ideal for use as keys in hash-based collections due to constant hash codes.

- **Prevention of Null or Invalid States**: Ensures all fields are properly initialized during object creation.

- **Simpler APIs**: Leads to cleaner and more reliable interfaces, as there are no methods to modify the state.

### Example Code

```java
public final class Point {
    private final int x;
    private final int y;

    public Point(final int x, final int y) {
        this.x = x;
        this.y = y;
    }

    public int getX() {
        return x;
    }

    public int getY() {
        return y;
    }
}
