   1. **Runtime Polymorphism (Dynamic polymorphism)**
      1. Method overriding
         1. **Definition**:
            It is a process in which a function call to the overridden method is resolved at Runtime. This type of polymorphism is achieved by Method Overriding.
   2. **Compile-time Polymorphism (Static polymorphism)**
      1. Method overloading
         1. **Definition**
            - means when there are multiple functions with the same name but different parameters then these functions are said to be overloaded. Functions can be overloaded by changes in the number of arguments or/and a change in the type of arguments.
   3. **Advantages of Polymorphism**
      - Increases code reusability by allowing objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common class.
      - Enables objects to be treated as a single type, making it easier to write generic code that can handle objects of different types.
      - Improves readability and maintainability of code by reducing the amount of code that needs to be written and maintained.
