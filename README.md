2. **Stack / heap b_memory** (Understanding b_memory management in Java)
3. **Object by reference or ... ? what ?** (How objects are passed and stored in Java)
4. **JVM / JDK / JRE** (Understanding the Java ecosystem and runtime environment)
5. **java memory model**
6. **Garbage collector** (Memory management and cleanup in Java)
7. **Static keyword** (Class-level variables and methods)
8. **final fields injection (final int a, final int b)** (Immutable fields and their usage)
9. **Throw / throws** (Exception handling basics)
10. **Generics** (Type-safe collections and methods)
11. **Collection 'List/Set/Queue' (ArrayList, Stack, LinkedList), (HashSet, LinkedHashSet), (Queues)**
12. **Map (HashMap, LinkedHashMap, Hashtable)**

## Advanced Topics

20. **Properties in interfaces '[Click Me](src/a_oop/abstraction/interfaces/test1)'** (Interface enhancements in newer Java versions)
21. **New switch expression** (Advanced switch syntax in modern Java)
22. **Singleton / Factory** (Common design patterns in Java)
23. **DI (Design pattern)** (Dependency Injection as a design pattern)
24. **MVC pattern** (Model-View-Controller architecture)
25. **Java beans in Spring-JEE** (Understanding Java beans and their role in frameworks like Spring)
26. **Hibernate/JPA Annotations** (Object-relational mapping and database interactions)
27. **JEE** (Java Enterprise Edition concepts and frameworks)

### **Bonus**
1. **100 Java Questions**: [Click me hh](src/z_other/java_100_questions)
2. **More Interview Questions**: [And me hh](src/z_other/interview_questions)

### Why This Order?
- **Foundational topics** are essential to understand how Java works at a basic level (b_memory, OOP, core constructs).
- **Intermediate topics** build on the basics, introducing more advanced features like functional programming, concurrency, and modern Java features.
- **Advanced topics** focus on design patterns, frameworks, and enterprise-level concepts, which require a solid understanding of the earlier topics.
